**Description:**

This project demonstrates how to build a comprehensive football analysis system using state-of-the-art AI and ML techniques. 

The system is capable of:

- Detecting and tracking players, referees, and the football throughout an entire video using the YOLO object detection model.
- Training the YOLO model to improve its accuracy on specific football datasets.
- Assigning players to teams based on their shirt colors using image segmentation and clustering.
- Calculating team ball acquisition percentage using optical flow.
  
**Key Features:**

**Object Detection**: Utilizes the YOLO object detection model to accurately identify and locate players, referees, and the football in video frames.

**Model Training**: Provides instructions for training the YOLO model on custom football datasets to enhance performance.

**Player Assignment**: Employs image segmentation and clustering techniques to segment player shirts and assign them to the correct teams.

**Team Analysis**: Calculates team ball acquisition percentage to assess offensive performance.
